# Computer-Vision-Project
### The title of the Project is:
## “Real time Object Detection and Distance Measurement using Computer Vision”
## Object Detection models:
### Mobile-Net SSD:
MobileNet is based on the ideology of depthwise separable convolutions, and it forms a factorized Convolutions which converts a basic standard convolution into a depthwise convolutions.
### YOLOv3 (used here for traffic-sign detection and recognition):
YOLO-V3 was inspired by ResNet and FPN (Feature-Pyramid Network) architectures, its feature extractor, Darknet-53 has 52 convolutions. It contains skip connections (like ResNet) and 3 prediction heads (like FPN) each processing the image at a different spatial compression.
## Face Recognition algorithm:
LBPH Face Recognizer (Haarcascades)
